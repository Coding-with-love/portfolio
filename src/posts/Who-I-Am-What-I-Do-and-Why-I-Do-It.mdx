Hey there — I’m Connor Love.

This is the very first blog post on my portfolio, and it’s meant to serve as both an introduction and a starting point. Whether you’re a future client, potential collaborator, or just someone curious about what I build, this should give you a clear and honest picture of who I am, what I do, and why I do it.

## 👋 About Me

I’m a **web developer, designer, and co-founder**, currently studying at **The Ohio State University**, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. While my academic background gives me a solid theoretical foundation, most of my skillset comes from **building real products** — solving real problems with code, design, and creativity.

I’ve always believed that the best way to learn is by doing — and that belief shapes how I work, what I pursue, and how I grow.

## 💼 What I Do

I focus on **frontend engineering and product design**, with full-stack capabilities when needed. I specialize in building **fast**, **responsive**, and **immersive web applications** — projects where performance, clarity, and user experience all matter.

### Technologies I work with:
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Motion & 3D:** Framer Motion, Three.js, custom GLSL shaders
- **Backend/Infra:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Vercel, Docker
- **Design Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD, handoff-ready component libraries

I bridge the gap between **engineering and experience** — taking rough product ideas and transforming them into real, polished user interfaces.

## 🚀 EduSynapse — Built from the Ground Up

One of the most ambitious and meaningful things I’ve built is **[EduSynapse](https://edu-synapse.com)** — an adaptive learning platform I co-founded and developed entirely on the frontend.

We built EduSynapse to solve a problem we saw in online education: most learning platforms are static, passive, and one-size-fits-all. EduSynapse flips that. It creates **personalized, interactive learning paths** that adapt to how each student learns best — whether that’s through reading, watching, doing, or reviewing.

As **co-founder and lead frontend developer**, I architected and built the entire frontend experience. Here are some of the most impactful features I developed:

### 🌱 Adaptive Learning Paths
Users can generate dynamic paths tailored to their learning style and progress. These paths update in real time as users complete modules, review mistakes, or opt for deeper practice.

### 📚 Custom Module Creation
Educators and admins can create interactive modules from scratch — including content blocks, assessments, feedback systems, and rich media — all managed through a custom editor I designed and built.

### 📊 Analytics & Progress Dashboards
Students and instructors can see detailed progress data, completion metrics, and engagement stats — all visualized in real time via responsive dashboards.

### 🛠 Admin Interface
I created a complete internal admin interface with access controls, content review flows, module publishing tools, and student-level oversight.

### 🔄 Real-Time Feedback & Remediation
EduSynapse surfaces knowledge gaps and adjusts the learning flow automatically. If a user struggles on a quiz, the platform inserts targeted review modules into their path.

### 🧩 Modular UI System
I built a scalable design system from scratch — reusable components, dark mode, accessibility, keyboard navigation — designed to move fast without sacrificing quality.

This project has pushed me further than any class, freelance job, or side gig. It’s taught me about product thinking, scalability, accessibility, and how to create something people actually use and learn from.

## 🧠 Why I Build

For me, building is about clarity and purpose. I love taking messy ideas and turning them into **usable, fast, and elegant products**. Whether I’m designing a UI from scratch or debugging an edge case in production, I care about the details — because that’s where good experience lives.

I build because:
- I like learning by doing.
- I love seeing people interact with something I made.
- I believe design and development should be in constant conversation.

I’m not just writing code — I’m **crafting experiences**.

## 📌 What’s Next

This blog and portfolio will be a home for:
- **Project write-ups and postmortems**
- **Dev process breakdowns**
- **Reflections on product-building and design thinking**
- Updates on EduSynapse and future launches

If you're interested in education, user-first design, or building cool things for the web — stick around.
