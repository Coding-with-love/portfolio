Hey there — I’m Connor Love.

This is the very first blog post on my portfolio, and it's designed to serve as both an introduction and a foundation. Whether you're a potential client, prospective partner, or just someone curious about what I make, this should give you an honest and straightforward rundown of who I am, what I do, and why I do it.

## 👋 About Me

I’m a **web developer, designer, and co-founder**, currently studying at **The Ohio State University**, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. While my academic background gives me a solid theoretical foundation, most of my skillset comes from **building real products** — solving real problems with code, design, and creativity.

I've always believed that the greatest way of learning is by doing — and it affects how I work, what I do, and how I grow.

## 💼 What I Do

I am a **frontend engineer and product designer** with full-stack skills when needed. I craft **fast**, **responsive**, and **immersive web apps** — projects where performance, simplicity, and user experience matter.

### Technologies I work with:
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Motion & 3D:** Framer Motion, Three.js, custom GLSL shaders
- **Backend/Infra:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Vercel, Docker
- **Design Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD, handoff-ready component libraries

I close the loop between **engineering and experience** — working with crude ideas for products and bringing them into being as actual, refined user interfaces.

## 🚀 Co-Founder of EduSynapse
EduSynapse is an AI-powered learning platform I co-founded to reimagine the way students learn — not by displacing education, but by **individualizing it**.
I wrote the **entire frontend** of the platform from scratch. Everything you see on the website — from the interactive knowledge graph to the code runner, learning path UI, and smooth animations — is designed and engineered by me.

Here's what EduSynapse offers:

- **AI-Generated Learning Paths**: We established an engine that generates personalized learning paths for each learner based on their mode of learning, goals, and progress. It adjusts dynamically, so each path is unique.

- **Smart Review System**: Following the principle of spaced repetition, the platform plans the right content at the right moment to allow learners to store information in the long term.

- **Interactive Knowledge Graphs**: The most uniquely identifiable aspect — a graph of ideas where students are able to visualize concepts and ideas connected to one another and drill down within context.

- **In-Browser Code Execution**: Whether Python or JavaScript, users are able to execute code in real-time in a secure environment without having to leave the lesson.

- **STEVE (AI Tutor)**: Our in-house AI assistant that explains, reinforces, and helps learners when they get stuck — like a tutor available 24/7.

- **Clean, Fast, Accessible UI**: My focus was on making the platform feel as intuitive and frictionless as possible — responsive, themeable, and performant.

Building EduSynapse has learned me more than any textbook ever taught me. I have learned how to roll out production-quality code under stress, collaborate with a lean but fierce team, and iterate constantly based on user feedback.

## 🧠 Why I Build

To me, building is purpose and simplicity. I like to take messy ideas and refine them into **usable, speedy, and beautiful products**. Whether I'm building a UI from scratch or debugging an edge case in prod, I listen to the little things — because that's where good experience happens.

I build because:
- I learn best by doing.
- I like seeing people interact with something that I made.
- I believe development and design must be in constant conversation.

I'm not just typing code — I'm **crafting experiences**.

## 📌 What’s Next

This blog and portfolio will be home to:
- **Postmortems and project write-ups**
- **Dev process breakdowns**
- **Thoughts on design thinking and product creation**
- EduSynapse news and future releases

If you're interested in education, user-centered design, or creating awesome things for the web — keep an eye out.
