title: "I Simulated the Internet in My Browser — and Now I Finally Understand It"
abstract: "In this post, I walk through how I built an internet simulation inside a Next.js app — visualizing everything from packet routing to TCP retries. You don’t need to be a networking expert to appreciate what really happens every time you open a website."

Most of us use the internet every day.

We stream, scroll, click, and upload — but we rarely stop to ask **how** it actually works under the hood. What *really* happens when you type a URL and press Enter?

I wanted to understand that for myself — not just by reading diagrams, but by actually **building it**.

So I created an interactive simulation inside a Next.js app. You can **watch data get split into packets**, **bounce across routers**, **deal with latency**, and finally arrive at its destination — just like the real internet.

Here’s how it works, and what I learned building it.

## The Big Idea

I built a **visual model of the internet’s communication process** — from typing in a domain to receiving a response.

The app shows:
- **DNS lookups**
- **TCP handshakes**
- **Packet fragmentation**
- **Routing hops**
- **Latency and packet loss**
- **Reassembly of data at the destination**

All of it is animated and explained step-by-step.

You don’t need to know anything about networking to follow it — the whole point is to make those invisible processes *feel* real.

## 🌐 What Happens When You Load a Web Page?

Here’s the simplified chain of events I modeled:

1. **You type a URL.**
2. **DNS Lookup**: Your device asks a DNS server for the IP address of that domain.
3. **TCP Handshake**: A connection is established between your computer and the server.
4. **Your message is split into packets** (like tiny pieces of a letter).
5. **Packets are sent across routers and nodes** to reach the destination.
6. **Some packets may get delayed or lost** and need to be retried.
7. **Once all packets arrive**, they’re reassembled into the full message.

I wanted to animate all of this in the browser — and I did.

## Building It in Next.js

I used **Next.js + React + CSS animations** (no Three.js) to build a clean, fast, and responsive simulation.

### Key elements I built:

#### 1. Visual Node Network
- Rectangles representing:
  - **Your Computer**
  - **DNS Server**
  - **ISP**
  - **Routers**
  - **Destination Server**
- Each node has animated lines showing data moving through it.

#### 2. Packet System
- The message (e.g., “GET /index.html”) is broken into **color-coded packets**.
- Packets animate from node to node.
- You can simulate **packet loss** — some packets disappear and get resent.

#### 3. TCP vs UDP Mode
- Toggle between:
  - **TCP (reliable, ordered)**
  - **UDP (fast, fire-and-forget)**
- In TCP mode, lost packets are **retried and re-ordered**.
- In UDP mode, lost packets are **gone forever** — which is fine for things like video or voice.

#### 4. Timeline Controls
- **Step-by-step mode**: Watch every hop one click at a time.
- **Live play mode**: See the full journey animated.
- **Latency slider**: Add artificial delays between hops.
- **“DDoS mode” toggle**: Simulate packet overload across a network.

## Why I Built This

I was tired of reading shallow networking tutorials that just say “packets go across the internet.”

That doesn’t *mean* anything until you see it.

When I built this simulation:
- I finally understood why **TCP is more reliable but slower**.
- I saw how **routing isn’t always a straight line**.
- I realized how much **invisible complexity** powers everyday web use.

And more importantly — I built something that helps *others* understand it too.

## Key Takeaways

- The internet is just a **series of tiny decisions**, happening at the speed of light.
- Networking isn’t magic — it’s a series of structured protocols and systems.
- Visualizing these processes makes them **real**, **memorable**, and even **emotional**.

I’ve always been a frontend developer — but building this helped me **respect the backend of the world** in a whole new way.

You can:
- Switch between TCP and UDP
- Watch packets fly, fail, retry, and succeed
- Actually feel the difference between “reliable” and “fast”

## Final Thoughts

This was one of the most rewarding things I’ve built — not because it was technically complicated, but because it turned something **abstract** into something you can **feel**.

If you’ve ever struggled to understand how the internet works, I hope this project helps.  
If you want to build your own — reach out. I’d love to help or collaborate.

Thanks for reading.
