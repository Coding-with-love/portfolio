When you think about websites, you probably think of scrollable pages, static images, and maybe some slick animations. But the modern browser can do much more — including running full-blown **3D environments**, right inside the page.

In this post, I want to show you how I’m using **Three.js** to push the boundaries of frontend design. I’ll walk you through:
- What Three.js is and how it works
- Why I use it in my portfolio to create depth and interaction
- How I built a floating 3D badge from scratch using physics, lighting, and React
- The tools and techniques that made it all come together

## So, What Is Three.js?

**Three.js** is a JavaScript library that lets you build and render 3D graphics in the browser using **WebGL** — the web standard that gives you direct access to the GPU.

Now, WebGL on its own is incredibly low-level and hard to use. You need to manage your own shaders, buffers, textures, camera projection matrices — it's like building a car engine just to drive to the store.

Three.js wraps all of that complexity in a friendly, developer-first API. Instead of writing raw shaders, you’re working with objects like:

- `Scene`
- `Mesh`
- `PerspectiveCamera`
- `DirectionalLight`
- `MeshStandardMaterial`

This abstraction lets you focus on design, animation, and interactivity — not boilerplate.

## Why I Use Three.js in My Portfolio

As a frontend developer and designer, I care about creating experiences that feel **alive** — ones that surprise, engage, and invite interaction.

Three.js helps me do exactly that.

In my portfolio, I’ve used it in multiple places:
- A **realistic 3D MacBook and phone** setup to showcase my design/dev toolkit
- Immersive scroll-triggered scenes
- And most recently — a standalone, interactive **floating badge**

Each use of Three.js brings motion, depth, and a physicality that flat UIs often lack.

And the best part? All of it runs **in the browser** — no plugins, no external apps, just HTML + JavaScript + WebGL.

## The Badge Demo: What I Built

The centerpiece of this post is a personal project I built to experiment with **real-time physics, 3D animation, and interactivity** in a browser environment.

It's a floating **conference-style badge**, and it behaves like something you’d actually wear at an event.

Here's what it does:
- It **swings and reacts** to physics when you click and drag it
- It’s attached to a **rope-style lanyard** that flexes and moves realistically
- It uses **metallic, clearcoated materials** and **environmental lighting**
- It’s fully interactive, **rendered in WebGL**, and **built with React**

You can see it live here:

## The Tools I Used

To build this, I used a stack of modern 3D tools that all work beautifully together in React:

- [`@react-three/fiber`](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction): React’s way of writing Three.js scenes
- [`@react-three/drei`](https://docs.pmnd.rs/drei/introduction): A collection of helpful abstractions for materials, lights, loading, etc.
- [`@react-three/rapier`](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-rapier): A full-featured physics engine for things like gravity, rigid bodies, joints, and collisions
- [`meshline`](https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine): For rendering thick lines (like ropes) in 3D space with width and texture

These libraries saved me hundreds of lines of boilerplate and made building the scene feel like composing a set of UI components.

## How I Built It — A Technical Breakdown

The structure of the scene is fairly straightforward, but powerful:

### The Scene

At the base of the app is a `<Canvas>` component provided by `@react-three/fiber`. This is like your WebGL “viewport.”

```jsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 13], fov: 25 }}>
  <Physics gravity={[0, -40, 0]}>
    <Band />
  </Physics>
</Canvas>
````

* The camera floats back at Z = 13 with a wide field of view
* Gravity is set downward with strong force to emphasize motion
* All physics-based objects are wrapped in a `<Physics>` provider

---

### The Rope System

The badge hangs from three invisible, rigid joints connected using `useRopeJoint`. These simulate the behavior of a lanyard that can bend and swing.

```jsx
useRopeJoint(fixed, j1, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], 1])
useRopeJoint(j1, j2, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], 1])
useSphericalJoint(j3, card, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1.45, 0]])
```

Each joint behaves like a mini physics object with defined constraints — they allow rotation, movement, and recoil just like a rope would.

---

### The Badge

The badge model is loaded via `useGLTF`, and includes multiple parts:

* A **card** base (like your name tag)
* A **metal clip**
* A **plastic clamp** where the rope attaches

I applied physically-based materials like this:

```jsx
<meshPhysicalMaterial
  map={materials.base.map}
  clearcoat={1}
  roughness={0.3}
  metalness={0.5}
/>
```

This gives the plastic parts shine and depth, and makes the metal actually reflect its environment.

---

### Lighting & Atmosphere

I used `Lightformer` and `Environment` from `drei` to simulate an HDR-lit environment with subtle light casting across the surface of the badge.

```jsx
<Lightformer intensity={10} position={[-10, 0, 14]} scale={[100, 10, 1]} />
```

This provides soft shadows and subtle specular highlights on edges — the kind of polish that brings realism to digital surfaces.

---

### The Rope (Visually)

While the physics handles movement, I needed a **visible white rope** to render. For this, I used `meshline`, which allows thick, styled 3D lines (unlike the native `THREE.Line`).

```jsx
<meshLineMaterial
  color="white"
  map={texture}
  repeat={[-3, 1]}
  lineWidth={1}
/>
```

The line repeats a fabric texture, giving the illusion of woven material. It animates naturally because it's tied to the same joint positions.

## Why This Matters

This demo might seem small, but it represents a much bigger idea:

> **The web is a canvas, not just a container.**

We’re no longer limited to flat text and buttons. With libraries like Three.js and tools like React, we can bring interfaces to life — and craft real moments of interactivity and emotion.

This badge project:

* Showcases a real-time physics simulation
* Demonstrates high-quality materials and lighting
* Reflects my style of development — clean, thoughtful, detail-oriented

Whether I’m designing UI, building complex product dashboards, or creating 3D art, the goal is the same: make the experience *feel* better.

## Final Thoughts

Three.js has opened up a whole new creative lane in my frontend work. It's not just about flash — it's about giving ideas **weight**, **motion**, and **presence**.

If you're curious to try this out in your own projects — or you're building a site and want it to feel unique — I’d love to chat or collaborate.

Thanks for reading.
